//! Domain-separated payload for delegated action signatures.
//!
//! Without explicit domain separation a signature created for one function
//! (e.g. `delegate`) could be replayed against a different function
//! (e.g. `revoke_delegation`) because both consume the same nonce namespace.
//!
//! This module introduces a [`DomainTag`] enum that labels *which* function
//! domain owns a given signature, and a [`DelegatedActionPayload`] struct that
//! binds together:
//!
//! * `domain`       — the specific action type / function domain
//! * `owner`        — the principal whose authority is being invoked
//! * `target`       — the address being acted upon (delegate or subject)
//! * `contract_id`  — the current contract's address (chain / deployment context)
//! * `nonce`        — monotonically increasing per-owner counter
//!
//! Signature verification must hash *all* of these fields together.  A
//! signature produced for `domain = Delegate` will be structurally incompatible
//! with a `revoke_delegation` call even if the nonce happens to match.
